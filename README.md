# fish-shell-prompt
Some pretty neat Fish shell prompt configs

## Requirements
- You should have `fish` installed
- You should have `omf` ([oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)) installed

## How to use
-> Make a copy of your `fish_prompt.fish` script file, located at `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` (just in case something goes wrong)
-> replace the conents of the `fish+prompt.fish` script with the script in this repo.
-> run `. ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` to reload the file and voila!

## Themes
So far there's only one theme, but stay tuned for more!
